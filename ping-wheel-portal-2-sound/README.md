# Ping Wheel - Portal 2 Ping Sound

This resource pack replaces the default sound in **LukenSkyne’s [Ping Wheel](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/ping-wheel)** mod with the familiar ping sound from **Portal 2 Co-op Mode**.

### **Compatibility**
This pack has been tested on **Minecraft 1.21.1**, but due to the structure of the mod’s assets, it should also work with earlier versions of the Ping Wheel mod.

### **Source**
The audio file used is `ui/beepclear.wav`, sourced from [sourcesounds/portal2](https://github.com/sourcesounds/portal2).  
It is utilized under **fair use** for non-commercial, transformative purposes.
