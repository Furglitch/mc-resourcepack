# Pretty Pretty Pipes: Mekanism

This resource pack brings the visual styling of the [_Pretty Pipez: Mekanism Edition_](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/pretty-pipez-mekanism-edition) resource pack to the [_Pretty Pipes_](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes) mod. The pack modifies pipe models and textures while maintaining item visibility within the pipes, but does **not** include connected texture/model support like the [_Pretty X Smart Pipez_](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/pretty-x-smart-pipez) resource packs.

---

### **Supported Mods**
- [_Pretty Pipes_](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)
- [_Pretty Pipes: Fluids_](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes-fluids)

### **License**
This resource pack utilizes assets from the _Pretty Pipez: Mekanism Edition_ pack in accordance with their GNUv3 license and is distributed under the same license.
