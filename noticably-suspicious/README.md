# Noticably Suspicious

This resource pack makes **Suspicious blocks** easier to spot without being too obvious, unlike other packs that add frames, adjust colors, or make other dramatic changes. The textures use standard vanilla assets with the block-breaking overlay applied on top, slightly modified for visibility.
